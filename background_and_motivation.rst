===============================================
Background and Motivation
===============================================

  This course is designed for students who hope to engage in scientific research.

  What do we mean by "scientific"? If you look up "science" in a dictionary you will probably find something similar to what is on the 
  `Wikipedia page for science <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science>`_:

    Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about nature and the universe.
    
  Two important words in that definition are "systematic" and "testable". 
  The most common form of scientific communication today is the publication of scientific work in a peer-reviewed journal.
  The process of getting your work published in such a journal involves convincing reviewers, who are other scientists, 
  that you have been systematic in your research and you have "tested" what you claim to have tested (for example, that your data show what you say they show).
  
  Now, not every person who does research will end up working as a scientist, but I would argue skills gained in being systematic about gathering knowledge, 
  and being able to convince people that you have performed legitimate tests on gathered information is useful beyond the scientific publishing.
  
Reproducible research
===============================

  One way in which you can convince others that you have done what you say you have done is to ensure your research is reproducible. 
  Another person should be able to read your paper and reproduce your results. 
  In 1989 Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann claimed to have carried out a successful cold fusion experiment,
  but others were unable to reproduce their results and thus their findings were considered unsound. 
  
  Naturally you want to avoid this sort of thing. Ideally all research should be reproducible. 
  But researchers actually have quite a poor track record for creating reproducible research. 
  Ask a senior academic staff member to reproduce the results from their PhD or even show the documentation of the data, figure preparation, etc. 
  Many will be unable to do so.
  
  In this course we are going to introduce you to various tools that will enable you to do research, 
  but we would like you to learn these in the context of research reproducibility. 
  We would hope that 20 years from now you will be able to reproduce the work that lead to any dissertation, thesis or paper. 
  In this regard, we are holding you to a higher standard than current academic staff! 
  But I believe it is better to be ahead of the curve on research reproducibility than behind it. 
  Many major journals are shifting to require more documentation of research methods to ensure reproducibility of published work.

Open source tools for research
=========================================

  On a more practical topic, there are many open source tools that are extremely useful for aspiring researchers. 
  A number of these will be covered in the course. 
  We will focus on tools that are open source. 
  This is for the basic reason that if you do research within a proprietary framework you erect barriers to research reproducibility. 
  
  In addition, you might not have funding available for the proprietary tools that are available at one institution if you
  move on to another. It is somewhat safer to use tools that you know you can download onto any computer legally. 
  
  The tools we will be using are:
  
    * The `Python programming language <https://www.python.org/>`_.
    * The `statistical software package R <http://www.r-project.org/>`_.
    * Version control using `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ and hosting sites `github <https://github.com/>`_ and `bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`_.
    * Open source `figure preparation and drawing tool Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/en/>`_.
    * Open source `Geographic Information System QGIS <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/>`_.
