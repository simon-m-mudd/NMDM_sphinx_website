Basic python
==============================================

  `python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is a programming language that is becoming increasingly popular in the scientific community. 
  In this course we want you to learn the basics of programming in a simple, well documented language, 
  but one that is also powerful and that you can use in your research.
  `python <https://www.python.org/>`_ ticks all of these boxes.
  
  There are loads of resources to help you learn python, so I will not try to reinvent the wheel here. 
  Instead you should familiarise yourself with the language using some of the many outstanding online resources dedicated to python.
  
First steps: use the web!
================================================

  `The first steps video is here <http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/export_data/EMDM_videos/DTP_NMDMcourse_video_015_pythonintro.mp4>`_.

  If you search for "python tutorials" on the web you will find a bewildering number of sites. 
  However, for this course I would like you to look at two in particular.
  
    * `Code academy python section <http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python>`_. This site provides interactive tutorials for python and other languages. 
      For the course you should start by going through the excercises. Before week 3 you should go through the exercises up to and including the 'loops' section. 
      You might also want to have a look at the file input and output section. 
    * `Software carpentry python pages <http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/python/index.html>`_. 
      As with everything done by software carpetry, these pages are fantastic. They are a bit more advanced than the code academy pages, and not interactive, 
      so I would look at these after you do the code academy excercises.
      
Next step: your first python script
===============================================

  In this section, we will make our first python script.
  This script will then be called from the command line.
  The video will take you through the creation of this file and how to get it on github.  
  
  `Setting up the github repository for your python scripts <http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/export_data/EMDM_videos/DTP_NMDMcourse_video_016_github_python.mp4>`_.
  
  You should create a folder, make a simple data file like this::
  
    1,2,3,4
    3,2,1,4
    2,3,4,1
    
  in your favourite text editor and call it some_data.csv in this folder. 
  
  Then, put this folder under git version control (see video or the git section if you don't know how to do this) and then link it with a new github repository. 
  
  `The next step is to make a python script <http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/export_data/EMDM_videos/DTP_NMDMcourse_video_017_pythonscript.mp4>`_.
  
  You'll see in the video the contents of the file. You should try to make your own file. 
  
  `Next, try to use the open command in python to extract data as strings <http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/export_data/EMDM_videos/DTP_NMDMcourse_video_018_pyreadfile.mp4>`_.

Playing with some example scripts
=============================================

  I've created a number of python scripts that you might want to modify and test how they work. 
  
  You can see the repository `by clicking here <https://github.com/simon-m-mudd/test_python_scripts>`_. 
  
  You might want to **fork** this repository (look for link in upper right corner). 
  More details about forking can be found on this website: :ref:`more_advanced_github`, 
  and by `clicking on the GitHub help pages <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_.
